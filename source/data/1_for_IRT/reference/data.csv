1,"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son.",1,5

The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden _ red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in.",5,5

10,"In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others.",7,5

That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents.

He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir.",16,3

Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir.",14,4

The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good.",17,5
